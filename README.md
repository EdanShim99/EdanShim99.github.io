In this Excel-based project, I demonstrated advanced data analysis and visualization skills by creating an interactive dashboard for coffee order analysis. The process began with data organization, where I employed sophisticated functions like XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH to efficiently match coffee orders with corresponding customer information. After thoroughly cleaning and formatting the data, I leveraged Excel's pivot table functionality to summarize and analyze the organized information. The analysis was then brought to life through a dynamic pivot chart, providing clear visual representations of key insights. To enhance user interactivity and data exploration, I integrated additional features such as a timeline for temporal filtering and slicers for multidimensional data segmentation. The final product is a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard that allows for in-depth analysis of coffee orders, showcasing my proficiency in Excel, data manipulation, and creating actionable business intelligence tools.
