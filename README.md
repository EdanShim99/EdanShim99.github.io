With this Excel-based project, I am demonstrating data analysis and visualization skills using coffee order data in order to create an interactive dashboard. Starting with customer and order data, I utilize functions such as XLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH in order to organize and create new columns to match customers with their corresponding coffee orders. I then analyzed the data using a pivot table, which was then brought to life using a dynamic pivot chart. To further enhance user interactivity, I integrated features such as a timeline and slicers. The final product is a comprehensive, user-friendly dashboard that allows for in-depth analysis of coffee orders.

In this Tableau-based project, I demonstrate visualization skills using airline data in order to create a dynamic, interactive dashboard on customer ratings. Importing in real data from British Airways, I created a custom parameter and calculated field to be able to dynamically display the type of rating. Several different types of visuals are utilized, including a global map, a timeline, and ratings by aircraft. To enhance user interactivity, various filters were integrated, including the option to filter by seat and traveler type. The final dashboard is an aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly tool for in-depth analysis of these British Airways ratings.
